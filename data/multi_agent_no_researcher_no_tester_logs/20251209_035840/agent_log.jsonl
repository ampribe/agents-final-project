Each agent has a ranked preference list for the agents in the opposite set.\n\nA matching is a set of pairs such that each agent appears in at most one pair. A matching is considered **unstable** if there exists a pair of agents (m, w) who are *not* matched to each other, but who *both* prefer each other over their current partners (or being unmatched).\nA matching is **stable** if it is not unstable.\n\nThe Gale-Shapley algorithm finds a stable matching. It is typically proposer-optimal, meaning each proposer gets the best possible partner they can in *any* stable matching.\n\nInput:\nThe input is a dictionary containing:\n- \"proposer_prefs\": A list of lists representing the preferences of the proposers (e.g., men). `proposer_prefs[i]` is a list containing the indices of the receivers (e.g., women) in order of preference for proposer `i`.\n- \"receiver_prefs\": A list of lists representing the preferences of the receivers (e.g., women). `receiver_prefs[j]` is a list containing the indices of the proposers (e.g., men) in order of preference for receiver `j`.\n\nThe number of proposers must equal the number of receivers (let this be `n`). Indices range from 0 to `n-1`.\n\nExample input:\nConsider 3 proposers (M0, M1, M2) and 3 receivers (W0, W1, W2).\nProposer Preferences (Men):\nM0: [W0, W1, W2]\nM1: [W1, W0, W2]\nM2: [W0, W1, W2]\nReceiver Preferences (Women):\nW0: [M1, M0, M2]\nW1: [M0, M1, M2]\nW2: [M0, M1, M2]\n```json\n{\n  \"proposer_prefs\": [\n    [0, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [0, 1, 2]\n  ],\n  \"receiver_prefs\": [\n    [1, 0, 2],\n    [0, 1, 2],\n    [0, 1, 2]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\nThe output should be a dictionary containing:\n- \"matching\": A list of `n` integers, where `matching[i]` is the index of the receiver matched to proposer `i`. Alternatively, it could be represented as a list of pairs `[[proposer_index, receiver_index], ...]`.\n\nExample output:\n```json\n{\n  \"matching\": [1, 0, 2]\n}\n```\nThis means:\n- Proposer 0 (M0) is matched with Receiver 1 (W1).\n- Proposer 1 (M1) is matched with Receiver 0 (W0).\n- Proposer 2 (M2) is matched with Receiver 2 (W2).\n\nYou can verify this is stable. For instance, M0 prefers W0 over W1, but W0 prefers M1 (her current partner) over M0.\n\n## References\n- Gale, D., & Shapley, L. S. (1962).
